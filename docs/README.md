# Documentation

This directory contains the documentation for the `SOPT-37th-DEMODAY` monorepo.

Primary entrypoint (MOC): [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)

Architecture (reading order): [`docs/architecture/README.md`](./architecture/README.md)

## Rules

- Keep docs **source-of-truth aligned** (describe what exists in the repo today).
- When a boundary changes (routes, APIs, env vars, deployment), update docs in the same PR.
- Prefer linking to code/config rather than duplicating it.
