# Documentation

This directory contains the living documentation for the `SOPT-37th-DEMODAY` monorepo.

## Where to start

- Start here: [`docs/architecture/README.md`](./architecture/README.md)

## Rules of thumb

- Keep documentation **source-of-truth aligned**: prefer describing what exists in the repo today.
- When a boundary changes (routes, APIs, env vars, deployment), update the relevant doc page in the same PR.
- Prefer linking to code/config files rather than duplicating them.
